# FIDE_DATA_ANALYSIS
Using Scottish pig data I developed a pig movement network for diseases surveillance as part of my PhD research

This involved accessing the data from a scottish pig health network database

Cleaning the data and doing some exploratory analysis first

using networkx python package I developed the movement network

Farms where treated as Nodes

Movement of pigs between farms was treated as edges and it was directional
